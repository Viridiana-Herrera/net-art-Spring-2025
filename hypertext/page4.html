    <em>Veronica stood by the door, her hand resting on the handle. Danaya stood next to her, a grin playing on her
        face.
    </em>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Danaya:</strong> “This is it! You’re really doing it, huh?”
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Veronica:</strong> “I think so… but there’s one last thing.”
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Danaya:</strong> “What’s that?”
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>Veronica glanced at the phone in her hand, then out the window at the lively city streets.
    </em>
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Veronica:</strong> “Should I take the taxi or the subway?”
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Danaya:</strong> “Well, the subway’s quicker, but a taxi’s more convenient—if you’re okay with the cost.”
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>Veronica sighed, weighing the decision. Will Veronica take the taxi or the subway?
