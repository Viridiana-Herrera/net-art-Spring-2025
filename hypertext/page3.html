  <h1><em>The First Date</em></h1>
  <hr>
  <em>Veronica stared at her phone, Logan’s invitation lingering in her mind. The Nines. Tonight. With me.
    She turned to Danaya, who was waiting expectantly.
    </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “So? What did you say?”
  <em>Veronica hesitated. She opened her mouth but closed it again.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “I can’t. I’m just not ready for this. It feels too… much. I should stay in.”
  <br>
  <br>
 <em>Danaya looked disappointed but didn’t argue.</em>

 <em>Later that night, Veronica sat on the couch, a bowl of popcorn in her lap. The familiar opening of The Wedding Singer filled the room, but she barely registered it.</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>She sighed deeply, her eyes flicking to her phone. Nothing.</em>
<br>
<br>
<em>She sank deeper into the couch, feeling the weight of her decision. What if I made a mistake?
  Another sigh escaped her lips as the movie played on, but it offered no comfort. She could’ve been at The Nines… with him. Instead, she was alone, watching a movie she’d seen a hundred times.</em>
