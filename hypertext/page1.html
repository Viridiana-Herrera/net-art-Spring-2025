  <h1><em>The First Date</em></h1>
  <hr>
  <em>Veronica had been perfectly content spending her rare day off curled up on the couch,
    lost in her Gilmore Girls binge. The apartment was quiet, and peaceful—until the front door slammed open.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “Veronica! You’re not going to believe what happened!”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Danaya burst into the living room, practically vibrating with excitement as she dropped onto the couch beside her.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “What? Did you see that Mads Mikkelsen look-alike again?”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “No, but I found out he works at the Whitney Museum! But that’s not the news.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica frowned.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “I’m scared. What did you do?”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “Relax, I didn’t kill anyone—yet. But I did go to the bookstore on 6th.
  You know, where Logan works?”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica’s stomach flipped. Logan. The guy she had been quietly crushing on since the day
    Danaya filmed at his bookstore. The guy she had embarrassed herself in front of just last week when she dropped a
    book on his foot.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “He asked about you. And I told him you were free today… so he’s going to call you!”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “Danaya, no. Please tell me this is a joke.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “It’s not. And my senses tell me he likes you back. Whether you like it or not, a man likes
  you. Now, answer your—”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica’s phone rang.
    She stared at the screen. Logan’s name.
    Danaya didn’t hesitate. She snatched the phone and answered it.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Danaya:</strong> “Hi, Logan! Yeah, Veronica is right here!”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Before Veronica could react, Danaya shoved the phone against her cheek.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “H-hi—um, hey Logan.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan</strong> “Hey, Veronica. So, I know this is kind of last minute, but I remember you mentioning to Danaya
  once that you’d love to go to The Nines. I got us a reservation for tonight. What do you think?”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica blinked in surprise. She had mentioned The Nines only once—when Danaya and she were talking about places
    they’d like to visit, and it had slipped out that she’d seen it pop up on her TikTok. But Logan had overheard. She
    never thought anyone would remember, let alone act on it.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “Wait, you remember that? You heard me say that?”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “Yeah, I remember you talking about it. Thought it’d be the perfect place for us to go
  tonight. What do you think?”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Danaya was practically jumping up and down beside her, mouthing say yes!
    <br>
    Veronica felt her heart race. A piano lounge. Fancy bites. Cocktails. The Nines.
    <br>
    <strong>Her first real date...with Logan.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    Would she say yes? Or would she say no?
