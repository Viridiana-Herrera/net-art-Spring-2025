  <h1><em>The First Date</em></h1>
  <hr>
  <em>Veronica walked down the street, her broken heel digging into the ground with every step.
    It was a slow, awkward march, and the more she walked, the more she felt like a failure.
    The excitement she had felt earlier seemed to fade with each passing moment.
    She kept glancing at her phone, the time ticking away, and all she could think about was how out of place she
    felt.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>The Nines was supposed to be a romantic, elegant night, a moment she had hoped would be magical. But right now, it
    felt like a disaster waiting to happen. The broken heel was just the beginning.
    Her heart raced with anxiety, and a wave of insecurity washed over her.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> "This is all wrong. I can’t do this"
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>She looked up at the entrance to the restaurant. She couldn’t walk in like this—broken heel, unprepared, feeling
    completely out of her depth.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she hesitated before pulling it out. Logan’s name flashed on the screen, and
    she could almost hear his warm voice in her head.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “Hey, I’m here. I can’t wait to see you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>She felt a lump form in her throat. Logan was waiting for her, excited for their night. But how could she show up
    like this? Broken, unsure, and embarrassed? Her chest tightened as the weight of the moment hit her. She couldn’t do
    it. She couldn’t face him, not like this. Not when everything felt so wrong.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>With trembling fingers, she typed out a message.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “I’m really sorry, Logan. I don’t think I can make it tonight. I’m not ready. I hope you
  understand.”
  <br>
  <br>
  She hit send, and her heart sank. She stared at the screen, wishing she could take it back, but she knew she couldn’t.
  She looked one last time at the restaurant, then turned away, her heart heavy with regret.
