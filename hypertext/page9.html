  <h1><em>The First Date</em></h1>
  <hr>
  <em>Veronica stepped out of the taxi, feeling the weight of the delay settle in her stomach. She spotted Logan
    standing outside the restaurant, his gaze drifting from the building to her as she approached. He gave her a small
    smile, but she could tell he’d been waiting a while.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “Hey, there you are. I didn’t think you were coming.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica’s heart sank as she rushed toward him.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica</strong> “I’m so sorry, Logan. The traffic was insane, and I tried to get here as fast as I could.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Logan shrugged, his voice calm and understanding.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan: </strong> “It’s all right. They had to give up the table, though. I waited as long as I could, but they
  couldn’t hold it any longer.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica felt a pang of guilt, but Logan quickly reassured her.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “Don’t worry about it. I’m just glad you made it. It’s not the end of the world. We’ll find
  another time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica exhaled, relieved. She hadn’t expected him to be so understanding.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica</strong> “I feel awful, but thank you for being patient with me.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “It’s no problem. Honestly, I’d rather wait for you than be sitting in there without you. We
  can reschedule, no stress.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica smiled, grateful for his kindness.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “I’d love that.”
