      <h1>Connection</h1>
      <p>Connection is the bond between two individuals whose lives are deeply intertwined. Some might call this being
        soulmates, but sometimes external circumstances tear them apart, preventing them from being together. Despite
        this, the intensity of the connection remains undeniable. It’s more than a fleeting attraction—it’s a profound
        experience that, for some, transforms into a bittersweet memory, leaving those who’ve lost it with a lingering
        sense of what could have been.</p>
