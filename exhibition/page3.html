      <h1>Yearning</h1>
      <p>Yearning is a powerful emotion, an all-consuming desire for someone that takes over a person. To yearn is to
        love someone so deeply that nothing else matters. They occupy the only space in your heart. Yearning can be
        one-sided, where the intensity of love makes it difficult to express those feelings. However, when that yearning
        is shared, it doesn’t fade—it grows stronger, deepening your love and fueling the longing even more.</p>
