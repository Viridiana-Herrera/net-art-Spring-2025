  <h1><em>The First Date</em></h1>
  <hr>
  <em>Veronica took the subway, hoping it would be the faster choice. But as she rushed to the platform, disaster
    struck—her heel got caught, and with a sharp snap, it broke off.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> Of course, this would happen to me… Ugh!
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>She made it to the next station, but now she was stuck. The Nines had a dress code, and there was no way she could
    show up with a broken heel. She was classier than that! Luckily, there was a thrift store nearby she knew well, and
    she did have some time to spare.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  Should Veronica stop by the thrift store to find a new pair of heels, or should she just walk to The Nines in her
  broken shoes and take her chances at the fancy lounge?
