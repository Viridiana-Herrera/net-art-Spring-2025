  <em>Veronica arrived at The Nines, stepping into the elegant lounge just in time. The soft piano music set the perfect
    atmosphere, and she took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. She had made a quick stop at the thrift shop
    before heading here, hoping to find a new pair of heels. She’d picked up a pair that fit perfectly! The thrill of the purchase made her feel more put together, like the night was
    starting to go in her favor.
    As she entered, she spotted Logan sitting at a table near the back. As soon as he saw her, he stood up. His nervous
    smile quickly transformed into a genuine grin.

  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “You made it… I’m really glad you’re here.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>He took a step toward her, his voice a bit hesitant but full of warmth.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “I, uh, wasn’t sure you’d say yes… I’ve wanted to ask you for a while, but I didn’t know if I
  was just going to mess it up.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica’s heart skipped a beat. She’d felt the same way. The anticipation, the nerves, the strange mix of
    excitement and fear.
    She’d never been good at reading signs, but something about Logan made her want to try.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “But I’m really glad you did. I’ve wanted to spend time with you, just us, for a while now.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>He pulled out her chair with a little more care than usual, helping her sit down as he took his seat opposite her.
    As she sat, Veronica could see the nervous energy in his eyes, but there was also something else—relief, maybe?
    Happiness.</em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “This place… I know it’s a bit fancy, but I thought it’d be perfect for our first date. I
  wanted it to feel special.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Veronica felt her nerves melt away. She had worried about whether she’d be able to live up to the evening’s
    expectations, but in this moment, it all felt just right. She couldn’t help but feel more
    confident than she had earlier.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Veronica:</strong> “I’m glad you asked. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I’m really happy to be here with
  you.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>Logan’s eyes lit up, and he gave her a soft, appreciative glance.
  </em>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logan:</strong> “You look amazing tonight.”
  <br>
  <br>

  <em>Her heart swelled with warmth. She was glad she had taken the chance to go to the store and find something that
    made her feel good. The conversation flowed easily, their shared excitement and nerves fading away as they laughed and talked. Veronica
    felt comfortable, seen, and happy. As they spent the evening together, every minute felt like it was meant to be,
    and for the first time in a while, Veronica was exactly where she needed to be.
