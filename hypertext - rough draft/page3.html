      <em>Veronica stared at her phone, Logan’s invitation lingering in her mind. The Nines. Tonight. With me.</em>
      <p><strong>Danaya:</strong> “So? What did you say?”</p>
      <em>Veronica hesitated. She opened her mouth but closed it again.</em>
      <p><strong>Veronica:</strong> “I can’t. I’m just not ready for this. It feels too… much. I should stay in.”</p>
      <em>Danaya looked disappointed but didn’t argue.</em>
      <em>Later that night, Veronica sat on the couch, a bowl of popcorn in her lap. The familiar opening of The Wedding
        Singer filled the room, but she barely registered it.</em>
      <em>She sighed deeply, her eyes flicking to her phone. Nothing.</em>
      <em>She sank deeper into the couch, feeling the weight of her decision. What if I made a mistake? Another sigh
        escaped her lips as the movie played on, but it offered no comfort. She could’ve been at The Nines… with him.
        Instead, she was alone, watching a movie she’d seen a hundred times.</em>
