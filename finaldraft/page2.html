      <em><span class="highlight">Veronica stared at her phone, Logan’s words still echoing in her mind. The Nines.
          Tonight. With him.</span></em>
      <p><strong>Danaya:</strong> “Well?”</p>
      <p><strong>Veronica:</strong> “Yes, I'd love to go!”</p>
      <p><strong>Danaya:</strong> “I knew it! You’re going to have the best time!”</p>
      <em><span class="highlight">Veronica let out a shaky laugh, her heart racing. She hung up the phone and felt a
          whirlwind of excitement and nerves hit her all at once. This was really happening.</span></em>
      <p><strong>Danaya:</strong> “Okay, you need to get ready. You can’t just throw on your usual work clothes for a
        date like this.”</p>
      <em><span class="highlight">Danaya was right. Veronica couldn’t just show up at The Nines in anything. She walked
          over to her wardrobe and carefully pulled together two outfits to choose from. Staring at the options, she
          felt the weight of the decision pressing on her.</span></em>
      <p><strong>Veronica:</strong> “Danaya, I don’t know what to pick!”</p>
      <p><strong>Danaya:</strong> “Just go with what feels right!”</p>
      <em><span class="highlight">Veronica took a deep breath. She had to choose, but she wasn’t sure which one would be
          the best fit.</span></em>
      <p><strong>Danaya:</strong> “So, which one?”</p>
      <em><span class="highlight">Veronica gazed at both outfits, torn between the choices.</span></em>
      <p>Which one should she pick?</p>
