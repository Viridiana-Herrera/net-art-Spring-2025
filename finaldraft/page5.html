    <p> <em>Veronica chose the taxi, even though it was a bit of a splurge. She sank into the backseat, hoping for a smooth
        ride, but the traffic was worse than she expected. The car barely moved, and each passing minute seemed to stretch
        on longer than the last.</em></p>
 
 <p><strong>Veronica:</strong> This is taking forever… What if I get there late?</p>
  
  <p><em>The city buzzed around her, but inside the cab, everything felt too still. She glanced at her phone and saw that
    The Nines was only a 10-minute walk away…
    Should Veronica get out and walk the rest of the way, or wait it out in the taxi?</em></p>
