  <p>  <em>Veronica arrived at The Nines, stepping into the elegant lounge just in time. The soft piano music set the perfect atmosphere as she spotted Logan sitting at a table near the back. When he saw her, he stood up, his nervous smile quickly transforming into a genuine grin.
  </em></p>

<p><strong>Logan:</strong> “You made it… I’m really glad you’re here.”</p>

<p><em>He took a step toward her, his voice a bit hesitant but full of warmth.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Logan:</strong> “I, uh, wasn’t sure you’d say yes… I’ve wanted to ask you for a while, but I didn’t know if I was just going to mess it up.”</p>

<p><em>Veronica’s heart skipped a beat. She’d felt the same way. The anticipation, the nerves, the strange mix of excitement and fear. 
  She’d never been good at reading signs, but something about Logan made her want to try.</em></p>

<p><strong>Logan:</strong> “But I’m really glad you did. I’ve wanted to spend time with you, just us, for a while now.”</p>

<p><em>He pulled out her chair with a little more care than usual, helping her sit down as he took his seat opposite her. 
  As she sat, Veronica could see the nervous energy in his eyes, but there was also something else—relief, maybe? Happiness.</em></p>

<p><strong>Logan:</strong> “This place… I know it’s a bit fancy, but I thought it’d be perfect for our first date. I wanted it to feel special.”</p>

<p><em>Veronica felt her nerves ease as she smiled back at him, realizing she’d been waiting for this moment too, even if she didn’t admit it to herself until now.
</em></p>

<p><strong>Veronica:</strong> “I’m glad you asked. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I’m really happy to be here with you.”</p>

<p><em>The weight of their shared feelings hung between them, but it was comfortable, natural. As they began to talk, the conversation flowed effortlessly, the tension between them melting away with each laugh, and each story they shared. For the first time, Veronica felt like she was exactly where she needed to be.</em></p>
