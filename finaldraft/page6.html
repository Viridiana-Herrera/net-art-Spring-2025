    <p><em>Veronica took the subway, hoping it would be the faster choice. But as she rushed to the platform, disaster
        struck—her heel got caught, and with a sharp snap, it broke off.
      </em></p>
  <p><strong>Veronica:</strong> Of course, this would happen to me… Ugh!</p>

  <p><em>She made it to the next station, but now she was stuck. The Nines had a dress code, and there was no way she could
    show up with a broken heel. She was classier than that! Luckily, there was a thrift store nearby she knew well, and
    she did have some time to spare.
  </em></p>

  <p><em>Should Veronica stop by the thrift store to find a new pair of heels, or should she just walk to The Nines in her
    broken shoes and take her chances at the fancy lounge?</em></p>
